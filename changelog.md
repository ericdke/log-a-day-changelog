# Changelog

## 1.5.0 (testing)

- Add event(s) to a category with the Shortcuts app. 

This new Shortcut accepts a list of date strings (format "2022/02/19 15:33"), a category title, and an optional note. Date strings can be entered manually, received as variables, or received directly from another shortcut action. A new event will be created for the selected category for each date string received by the shortcut.
